        CryptoTimeFrame cards are <b className="text-main">Bitcoin</b> exclusive
        for now, but we plan to have more cryptocurrencies that our community
        demands. All crypto timeframe card owners will have priority in every
        release of new cryptocurrencies time frames. For cryptocurrencies that
        have been already release, we will get out new timeframes yearly. <br />{" "}
        The <b className="text-main">value</b> we see as a team on this cards is that you are not just buying
        a unique crypto time frame card, you are buying history! Just imagine
        the million of feelings involve on those charts, all that hope, fear,
        anxiety, happiness, etc. that’s what really empowers theses cards,
        that’s what they truly represent. <br /> CryptoTimeFrame is one of many
        other projects that will come in the future in the NYOI ecosystem and
        they will be all interconnected, meaning that if you are part of our
        community it will be a pleasure for us to give you priority and more
        benefits in upcoming projects.
